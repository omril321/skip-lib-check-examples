# TypeScript's `--skipLibCheck` Examples

This is a demo project, simulates a TS project. The goal is to simulate a project with different scenarios, regarding to dependencies validity and the TS compilation configurations.  
Each folder represents an interesting scenario for the `skipLibCheck` flag. You will find relevant explanations in each of the folder.
Run `npm run tsc` or `npm run tsc-with-skipLibCheck` inside each folder to examine the behavior of `skipLibCheck`. There's no need to run `npm install`.
